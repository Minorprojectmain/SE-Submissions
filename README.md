# Voiceless Saints - Your Pet Buddy

## About

Pet Owners often face the difficulty of finding someone to leave their pets with when they are going out of the station. 

They mainly rely on their neighbours to look after their pets. 
Nowadays, in metro cities where life is very fast-moving some even don’t know their neighbours very well. 
This compels them to leave their pets in government kennels but due to very low funding their maintenance is not given priority and pets have to suffer a lot. 

# Our Motivation :
1. The population of pet dogs in India amounted for around 19.5 million in the year 2018. The population was forecast to reach over 31 million by the end of year 2023.
2. No viable option is available in public domain for specified problem.
3. The pet-care sector in India — already pegged at over Rs 81 billion — is expected to grow at over 35 per cent every year (source: figures by DogSpot.in as reported by Business Standard).
4. The biggest shift has been in how pets today are considered family members. People no longer refer to themselves as *pet owners*, but as **‘proud pet parents’**.

## Installation

Next.js is a framework that makes it easy to create 'universal' React apps - React apps that do both client and server side rendering.

With Next.js, React pages are automatically rendered on both client and server side, without the hassle of setting up dependancies like webpack or babel and with automatic routing and without the constraints of projects like Create React App.

This provides an example of how to use Next.js with Express, SASS/SCSS, Bootstrap, Reactstrap (Boostrap 4 for React), the Ionicons icon set, examples of how to include data from remote REST APIs and incorporate an authentication system that supports both oAuth and Email using Passport (a popular authentication framework for Node.js).

## Running locally in development mode

To get started, just clone the repository and run `npm install && npm run dev`:

    git clone https://github.com/Minorprojectmain/Voiceless_Saints.git
    npm install
    npm run dev

Note: If you are running on Windows run install --noptional flag (i.e. `npm install --no-optional`) which will skip installing fsevents.

## Building and deploying in production

If you wanted to run this site in production, you should install modules then build the site with `npm run build` and run it with `npm start`:

    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start

You should run `npm run build` again any time you make changes to the site.

Note: If you are already running a webserver on port 80 (e.g. Macs usually have the Apache webserver running on port 80) you can still start the example in production mode by passing a different port as an Environment Variable when starting (e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`).

## Configuring

If you configure a .env file (just copy [.env.example](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/blob/master/.env.example) over to '.env' and fill in the options) you can configure a range of options.

See the [AUTHENTICATION.md](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter/blob/master/AUTHENTICATION.md) for how to set up oAuth if you want to do that. It suggested you start with Twitter as it's the easiest to get working.
